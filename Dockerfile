# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Production image for sadighi.nextuply.com — Next.js 15 + Prisma.
#
# Four-stage build:
#   1. deps       — full `npm ci` (incl. devDependencies), needed to run
#                    `next build` (TypeScript/Tailwind compile at build
#                    time) and `prisma generate`.
#   2. build      — runs `prisma generate` then `next build` against the
#                    deps stage's node_modules.
#   3. prod-deps  — a SEPARATE, production-only `npm ci --omit=dev`, kept
#                    apart from the `deps` stage specifically so the final
#                    image never carries typescript/eslint/tailwind/the
#                    `prisma` CLI package — "avoid unnecessary
#                    dependencies" per the deployment brief.
#   4. runner     — prod-only node_modules, PLUS the exact generated
#                    Prisma client copied over from the `build` stage
#                    (see the comment on that COPY below for why this
#                    isn't left to `@prisma/client`'s own postinstall).
#
# Build and runtime both use the same `node:22-alpine` base, so Prisma's
# auto-detected "native" query engine binary target matches between
# `prisma generate` (build stage) and actually running the app (runner
# stage) — no explicit `binaryTargets` needed in schema.prisma. Alpine
# needs `openssl`/`libc6-compat` for Prisma's engine and for Next.js's
# native image-optimization module (`sharp`) to work; installed below.
#
# No secrets are baked into this image at any stage — real env values are
# supplied at container-run time via `.env.production`/`.env.db` (see
# docker-compose.production.yml), never `COPY`'d or `ARG`'d here.

# Round 2026-07-17 (per Hamid): `scripts/verify-staging-db.ts`,
# `verify-sms-config.ts`, `verify-ai-gateway.ts` are run manually against
# the deployed image (`docker compose run --rm sadighi-app npm run
# verify:...`) — they need `scripts/` itself plus the plain-TS source
# files they import (`src/modules/smart-clinic-assistant/{server/otp,ai}
# /*`). `tsx` is already a production `dependency` (package.json), so it
# was already present via `prod-deps` above — only the source text was
# missing, which is the actual bug this fixes. Copying all of `src/`
# rather than hand-picking an exact minimal file list: these scripts
# deliberately avoid `@/`-aliased imports (see verify-staging-db.ts's own
# doc-comment — bare `tsx` runs don't get Next.js's alias resolution), so
# their relative imports could reach anywhere under `src/`, and a curated
# subset would silently break the next time one of them gains an import.
# `src/` is plain TypeScript source already in git — no secrets, no build
# output, negligible size next to `node_modules`/`.next`.
